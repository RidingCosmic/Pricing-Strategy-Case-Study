# Impact Analysis
Impact analysis in product management is a crucial process that predicts the potential consequences of disruptions to a business's operations and systems. This analysis allows for collecting relevant
data to develop recovery and mitigation strategies, aiding in risk
management, business continuity planning, and disaster recovery planning.
An impact analysis in this context aims to discern the correlations between driver
acquisition costs and churn rates and their resulting influence on Lyft's revenue. It's critical
to grasp the co-dependence of driver availability and rider satisfaction as they aJect
service reliability and, ultimately, the company's financial performance.
Revenue Impact
The table below shows a simple revenue calculation: Lowering Lyftâ€™s net revenue per ride by
50% in favor of a higher match rate of 93% will result in ~23% lower net monthly revenue, but
the significant improvement of the match rate (from 60% to 93%) will likely decrease churn
for both riders and drivers.

Better earning potential and a higher ride match rate make the driving job more appealing
and financially rewarding, which could lead to higher retention. Importantly, by improving
the match rate to 93% by reducing Lyft's take, fewer riders experience failed matches. This
should significantly reduce rider churn to the lower baseline of 10%, a substantial
improvement that could significantly impact our revenue.

**Driver CAC and Churn Rate**

The CAC for drivers ranges from $400 to $600, with a churn rate of 5%; eJective retention
strategies and higher driver satisfaction from better earnings can reduce the frequency with
which new drivers need to be onboarded (driver churn rate), potentially lowering the average
CAC and reducing the 5% churn rate even further.

**Rider CAC and Churn Rate**

Service reliability and satisfaction (due to higher match rates) are critical for riders. Riders
experiencing failed matches (60% current match rate means 40% are unmatched) have a
higher churn rate (33%). By improving the match rate to 93% by reducing Lyft's take, fewer
riders experience failed matches, which should significantly reduce rider churn to the lower
baseline of 10%. Additionally, it reduces the need for constant re-acquisition and thus
lowers the CAC from its current range of $10 to $20.

**Interdependence between driver and rider behavior**

There is a strong correlation between driver and rider behavior and trip cost. If driver pay per
trip is reduced too much (to increase company margins), drivers may leave the platform,
reducing ride availability. This, in turn, can lead to longer wait times or no available rides for
customers, increasing rider churn due to dissatisfaction. Conversely, if Lyft increases driver
pay by reducing its take from the fare, it might attract more drivers and reduce driver churn,
improving availability and potentially reducing rider churn, but it would lose revenue. In
essence, Lyft must strike a balance between a pricing structure that maximizes driver
retention and availability while keeping rides aJordable and accessible to maintain and grow
rider demand.
