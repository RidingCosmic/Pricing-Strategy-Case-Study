# Strategic Recommendation to Improve Revenue
To improve Lyft's revenue strategically, a product manager should apply an entrepreneurial
mindset and focus on simplicity when solving identified problems. Reducing Lyft's cut per
ride might lower immediate net revenue, but this strategy can enhance the match rate,
decrease churn, and build long-term sustainability and market penetration. Consequently,
it can raise overall revenue over a year through increased loyalty and retention.
Simultaneously, a product manager should focus on innovating with existing and available
resources. As discussed in Appendix B, one way to kick oJ this is by organizing an ideation
session. They can apply the Diverge-Converge principle to select feasible, desirable, viable
ideas and generate value for the organization and its stakeholders.
In this case, the following 2 ideas appear to meet these criteria,

1. Adopt Combination Pricing Modeli,ii: Implement a flexible pricing strategy that adjusts
to real-time supply and demand dynamics and incentivizes drivers during peak
demand periods to increase availability and match rates.
2. Experimentation and Data-Driven Adjustments: Use data analytics to continuously
monitor and adjust the pricing strategy in real time. This approach will allow Lyft to
respond dynamically to supply and demand changes, optimizing match rates and
overall revenue.
Lyft is known for its innovativeness in data science. A product manager should leverage their
internal network and influence to quickly and eJectively rally an internal team to implement
or reuse similar strategies deployed in other markets.
## Worst-case Scenario
Cutting driver payout rates, although possibly beneficial to short-term revenue, can have
damaging long-term eJects. Such reductions may decrease driver satisfaction, leading to
an exodus towards competitors, reduced match rates, and higher driver turnover—all
negatively impacting customer satisfaction. This approach will tarnish Lyft's brand image
and core values if perceived as prioritizing profits over fair driver compensation, potentially
inviting regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges.
A successful product manager should anticipate such decisions and develop a
comprehensive communication strategy to inform drivers of changes and support measures
transparently. This transparency will help maintain trust and mitigate the potential fallout
from reduced compensation. However, they must act with explicit direction from
management on such critical matters.
OJering support during challenging times helps mitigate the adverse eJects of tough
decisions, such as reducing driver payouts. It solidifies Lyft's reputation as a company that
values its drivers and the community. By implementing comprehensive support programs,
Lyft can demonstrate its commitment to its workforce, ensuring drivers feel valued and
supported even when the company must make diJicult financial decisions. Such measures
help retain drivers, boost morale, and promote a positive corporate image, reinforcing Lyft’s
role as a responsible and caring employer within the sharing economy.
## Conclusion
The strategies and action plan mentioned above will address the immediate challenges and
set a foundation for long-term success in the Toledo market. Lyft can achieve revenue and
growth objectives by focusing on strategic pricing, data utilization, and exceptional service
delivery while maintaining a competitive edge and market relevance. These eJorts
demonstrate Lyft's commitment to its drivers and customers, reinforcing its reputation as a
responsible and innovative company. Additionally, this strategic approach aligns with Lyft’s
core valuesiii and addresses the critical elements needed for successful market penetration
and sustainable operation.
