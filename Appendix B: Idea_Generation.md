# Appendix B: Diverge-Converge Principle for Idea Generation
To increase overall revenue and create competitive advantage and market dominance, Lyft should
develop valuable strategies and actions (to consumers and the community) that are rare (not
oJered by competitors) and not easily imitable.
The product manager's goal should be to improve service reliability by optimizing match rates within
the next 12 months. An eJective product manager uses diverge-converge principles to generate and
select solutions. Ideally, I would bring a multi-disciplinary, cross-functional teamv and lead them
through the divergent-converge process to harness the collective creativity of the team to generate
innovative solutions. I would then apply strategic thinking and/or organizational criteria to select the
best options to move forward with. This would be an iterative approach that allows me to
continuously refine the idea and align it with business and user needs.
For the sake of this exercise, I conducted a solo idea generation session and generated the list
below.

**1. Adopt Combination Pricing Model <sup>vi,vii</sup>:** Implement a flexible pricing strategy that adjusts to
real-time supply and demand dynamics and incentivizes drivers during peak demand
periods to increase availability and match rates.

**2. Experimentation and Data-Driven Adjustments:** Use data analytics used to monitor and
adjust the pricing strategy in real time continuously. This approach will allow Lyft to respond
dynamically to supply and demand changes, optimizing match rates and overall revenue.

**3. Improved Demand Forecasting:** Leverage predictive analytics to position drivers optimally
during expected demand surges.

**4. Enhanced Rider/Driver Experience:** Use AI to match riders and drivers for optimal ride
experiences, potentially increasing loyalty, and satisfaction.

**5. Increased Driver Retention <sup>viii</sup>:** Develop incentive programs tailored to driver needs, avoiding
a one-size-fits-all approach to enhance driver loyalty.

**6. Boosted Customer Loyalty:** Employ Design Thinking to make the Lyft app usage a habit-
formingix, rewarding customer experience.

**7. Promote Social Benefits of Ride Sharing <sup>x</sup>:** Emphasize Lyftâ€™s contributions to environmental
sustainability and workforce diversity. Lyft could showcase initiatives to reduce emissions in
heavily polluted areas, increase ride safety, and commit to increasing female participation
in its driver network by setting tangible goals.

**8. Build Partnerships and Alliances <sup>xi</sup>:** Forge exclusive partnerships with major companies in
downtown Toledo to become the preferred rideshare provider for business travelers.

**9. Collaborating with financial organizations** to offer affected drivers loans with reduced
interest rates or flexible repayment terms.

**10. Developing a partnership with auto manufacturers** and/or dealers to oJer vehicle leases with
lower monthly payments or other flexible terms.

**11. Promote Coopetition:** Partner with competitors to help impacted drivers get certified on their
platforms faster.

**12. Offering driver education** programs by partnering with local universities or schools can
strengthen Lyft's commitment to improving local communities.
