# Pricing-Strategy-Case-Study
## Objective:
As the Pricing Product Manager for Lyft, my goal is to maximize net revenue for the route between Toledo Express Airport and downtown Toledo over the next 12 months. This involves adjusting the driver payout and Lyft’s take rate while maintaining rider affordability at the prevailing market rate of $25 per ride.

## Executive Summary
The prevailing rate for rides between Toledo Airport and downtown Toledo is $25, with drivers earning $19. Currently, only 60% of ride requests are matched with drivers, resulting in high rider churn. A pricing experiment showed that reducing Lyft’s take per ride from $6 to $3 significantly improved match rates from 60% to 93%. The challenge is to determine the optimal driver payout to maximize Lyft’s net revenue while balancing match rates, driver retention, and rider satisfaction.

## Key Metrics and Current Economics
**Drivers**
	•	Prevailing Wage: $19 per ride.
	•	Monthly Churn: 5%.
	•	Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $400–$600 per driver.
	•	Ride Volume: 100 rides/month per driver.

**Riders**
	•	Rate: $25 per ride.
	•	CAC: $10–$20 per rider.
	•	Monthly Churn:
	•	10% for riders without a failed match event.
	•	33% for riders with a failed match event.
